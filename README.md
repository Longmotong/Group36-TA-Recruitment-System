# TA Recruitment System

## Project Overview

This project implements a **Teaching Assistant Recruitment System** designed for BUPT International School.  
The system aims to streamline the recruitment process by allowing students to apply for teaching assistant positions while enabling module organisers to manage job postings and review applications.

The project is implemented as a **stand-alone Java application** and developed using **Agile methods**, including iterative development, version control using GitHub, and modular system design.
